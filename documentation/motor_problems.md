25th november general cooling loop (shutdown)
18-20 october general cooling loop - Train on September, test for October
9th february grundfoss


Compare 4 cvae models (all, flux, vib, current) - start with the problem on the 18-20th october
Compare then with the PCA
figure out
- Training data - use whatever there was before as a baseline??
- Run talos training for each of the channels (Vibration, flux, current) (Should have the all measurements one saved at least) (Could possibly use just these models as well for the november error)
- Train a PCA model as well for these errors
- Compare the results of all models between each other

We also will want to compare models to PCA with normal test samples that have no error (do we??)

9th of february has limited measurements (only flux and vibration, no current) - 
So, we can compare 2 models here, but again they should be already trained
